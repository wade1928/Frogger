# Frogger the game of speed and luck
The objective of the game is to collect the blue gem located in the middle of the board, and then proceed to the water area at the top.  Enemies will try to bump you back down to the starting position.  If you proceed to the water without collecting the blue gem, you will be bumped back to the starting position.  The maximum high score is five stars.  Each time you collide with an enemy, the score is decreased by one star.  Good luck!
